Dear Reviewer

Enclosed in this folder you will find two solutions for visual studio 2022: "SodaMachine.sln" and "SodaOrderService.sln"

The former is my submission for an improved source code for the console application intended to "physically" interact with the sodamachine.
Except for the "sms-order" functionality it should have all its original functions aswell as some additional ones I deemed  usefull.

The latter solution was designed to replace the "sms-order" function of the original app, and applies a very basic .net API structure together with a simple website which allows you to order sodas for pickup at the machine.

These two solutions are intended to be run simultaneously and will communicate with each other.

Please open them both and start them with the ctrl+f5 command to check it out ðŸ˜€

Enjoy!
